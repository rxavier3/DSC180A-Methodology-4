1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
    The most interesting topic covered in our domain this quarter was the topic of factuality factors, which are specific criteria by which truthfulness is measured. The reason why it is so interesting is because it gives you so many different perspectives and ways to measure the truthfulness of a statement, like a statement's sensationalism or political bias. Prior to this, I honestly just thought the only way to assess a statement's truthfulness, was if the content was empirically backed.
2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
    A potential investigation I would like to pursue for my Quarter 2 project is doing fake image analysis or mislabeled captions. A huge aspect of the news has always been visual images and photos, and often times, people intentionally photoshop photos or add misleading captions to manipulate audiences. Having the chance to verify photos and captions would be really interesting.
3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
    I think that I would've started with doing the Predictive AI pipeline first as opposed to Generative AI. By doing the Predictive AI pipeline first, I can focus more on understanding the concepts of fake news classification first as opposed to spending most of my time coding from the jump.
4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
    One technique I am interested in using my project is trying out more HuggingFace transformers, which I researched a lot and found that there are so many unique transformers in the world of truth classification. Another technique I am interested in using for my project is using Agentic AI frameworks, and building an AI chatbot for users to interact with about the truthfulness of the current news article they are reading
